What if baseball bats didn't exist

The purpose of this project is to simulate any given MLB player's regular season (data availability permitting) as if they didn't have a baseball bat. Obviously, every pitcher would just throw easy floaters into the strike zone and there would just be a lot of strike outs, however; the catch is the pitchers don't know that our player doesn't have a bat, therefore the pitchers will throw exactly the same pitches they did in real life and the player will just never swing.

The program will return the player's At Bats, Bases On Balls, Intentional Bases On Balls, and On-Base Percentage. Granted there will be many players that will not have very interesting statistics, but the best hitters will have the the fear of a home-run on their side, which will lead to many intentional walks (see Barry Bonds 2004).

The information for this project if collected from retro sheet and the inspiration for this project comes from "What if Barry Bonds had played without a baseball bat?" by SecretBase on Youtube.
